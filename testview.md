## Review of Sets and Mathematical Notation

A set is a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called **elements** or **members** of the set, and they can be anything, including numbers, letters, people, cities, and even other sets. By convention, sets are usually denoted by capital letters and can be described or defined by listing their elements and surrounding the list by curly braces. For example, we can describe the set \( A \) to be the set whose members are the first five prime numbers, or we can explicitly write: 

\[ A = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\} \]

If \( x \) is an element of \( A \), then we write \( x \in A \). Similarly, if \( y \) is not an element of \( A \), then we write \( y \notin A \). Two sets \( A \) and \( B \) are said to be **equal**, written as \( A = B \), if they have the same elements. The order and repetition of elements do not matter, so
